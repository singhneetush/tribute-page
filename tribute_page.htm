        <p><strong>Queen of Jhansi</strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p>Lakshmibai, the Rani of Jhansi , 19 November 1828 â€“ 18 June 1858),was an Indian queen of the Maratha princely state of 
        Jhansi in North India currently present in Jhansi district in Uttar Pradesh, India.She was one of the leading 
        figures of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and became a symbol of resistance to the British Raj for Indian nationalists.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Early life of Chhabili</strong></p><br>
        <hr>
        <p>Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November 1828 in the town of Varanasi into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family.
        She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu.Her father was Moropant Tambe and her mother Bhagirathi 
        Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came from Maharashtra.Her mother died when she was four years old.
        Her father was the Commander of the war of Kalyanpranth. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district.
        The Peshwa called her "Chhabili", which means "playful". She was educated at home, able to read and write, and was more
        independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included shooting, horsemanship, fencing  and 
        mallakhamba with her childhood friends Nana Sahib and Tatya Tope. Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal
        cultural expectations for women in India's society at this time.</p>

        <p> Lakshmibai was accustomed to riding on horseback accompanied by escorts between the palace and the temple, although 
        sometimes she was carried in a palanquin. Her horses included Sarangi, Pavan and Baadal; according to historians she
        rode Baadal when escaping from the fort in 1858. Her palace, the Rani Mahal, has now been converted into a museum.
        It houses a collection of archaeological remains of the period between the 9th and 12th centuries AD.pre</p>

        <div>
            <p>Manikarnika was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, in May 1842 and was afterwards 
        called Lakshmibai (or Laxmibai) in honour of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi and according to the Maharashtrian tradition of 
        women being given a new name after marriage. In September 1851, she gave birth to a boy, later named Damodar Rao, who 
        died four months after birth. The Maharaja adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was
        renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before the Maharaja died. The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer 
        who was given a letter from the Maharaja instructing that the child be treated with respect and that the government of Jhansi 
        should be given to his widow for her lifetime.</p>
        </div>

        <p>After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was an adopted son, the British East 
        India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the 
            throne and annexing the state to its territories. When she was informed of this she cried out <mark> "Main apni Jhansi nahi doongi"
            (I shall not surrender my Jhansi) </mark>. In March 1854, Rani Lakshmibai was given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to 
            leave the palace and the fort.</p>
            
        <p>According to Vishnu Bhatt Godse the Rani would exercise at weightlifting, wrestling and steeplechasing before breakfast. 
            An intelligent and simply-dressed woman, she ruled in a business-like manner.</p>

        <p><strong>The First War of Independence , 1857 </strong></p>
        <hr>
        
        <strong>Early Beginning</strong>
        
        
        <p>On 10 May 1857 the Indian Rebellion started in Meerut. When news of the fighting reached Jhansi, the Rani asked the British political
            officer, Captain Alexander Skene, for permission to raise a body of armed men for her own protection; 
            Skene agreed to this. The city was relatively calm in the midst of the regional unrest, but the Rani conducted 
            a Haldi Kumkum ceremony with pomp in front of all the women of Jhansi to provide assurance to her subjects, in 
            the summer of 1857 and
            to convince them that the British were cowards and not to be afraid of them.</p>


            <p> Till this point, Lakshmibai was reluctant to rebel against the British. In June 1857, rebels of the 12th Bengal Native Infantry seized the 
                Star Fort of Jhansi containing the treasure and magazine, and after persuading the British to lay down their arms by promising 
                them no harm, broke their word and massacred 40 to 60 European officers of the garrison along with their wives and children.
                The Rani's involvement in this massacre is still a subject of debate.An army doctor, Thomas Lowe, wrote after the 
                rebellion characterising
                her as the "Jezebel of India ... the young rani upon whose head rested the blood of the slain".</p>            
            
            
           <p> Four days after the massacre the sepoys left Jhansi, having obtained a large sum of money from the Rani, and having
                threatened to blow up the palace where she lived. Following this, as the only source of authority in the city the Rani
                felt obliged to assume the administration and wrote to Major Erskine, commissioner of the Saugor division explaining the
                events which had led her to do so.[29] On 2 July, Erskine wrote in reply, requesting her to "manage the District for the
                British Government" until the arrival of a British Superintendent.The Rani's forces defeated an attempt by the mutineers
                to assert the claim to the throne of a rival prince Sadashiv Rao (nephew of Maharaja Gangadhar Rao) who was captured and 
                imprisoned.</p>

            
            <p>There was then an invasion of Jhansi by the forces of Company allies Orchha and Datia; their intention however was to divide Jhansi between 
                themselves. 
                The Rani appealed to the British for aid but it was now believed by the governor-general that she was responsible for
                the massacre and no reply was received. She set up a foundry to cast cannon to be used on the walls of the fort and assembled 
                forces including some from former feudatories of Jhansi and elements of the mutineers which were able to defeat the invaders in
                August 1857. Her intention at this time was still to hold Jhansi on behalf of the British.
            </p>

            <strong>Seige of Jhansi</strong>
            <hr>
            <p>From August 1857 to January 1858 Jhansi under the Rani's rule was at peace. The British had announced that troops would be sent there
                to maintain control but the fact that none arrived strengthened the position of a party of her advisers who wanted independence from
                British rule.
                When the British forces finally arrived in March they found it well-defended and the fort had heavy guns which could fire over the 
                town and nearby countryside. According to one source Hugh Rose, commanding the British forces, demanded the surrender of the city;
                if this was refused it would be destroyed. 
                The same source claims that after due deliberation the Rani issued a proclamation: "We fight for independence.
                In the words of Lord Krishna, we will if we are victorious, enjoy the fruits of victory, if defeated and killed on the 
                field of battle, we shall surely earn eternal glory and salvation." Other sources, 
                for example, have no mention of a demand for surrender. She defended Jhansi against British troops when Sir Hugh Rose 
                besieged Jhansi on 23 March 1858.

            </p>
            <p>The bombardment of Jhansi began on 24 March but was met by heavy return fire and the damaged defences were repaired. 
                The defenders sent appeals for help to Tatya Tope;an army of more than 20,000, headed by Tatya Tope, was sent to
                relieve Jhansi but they failed to do so when they fought the British on 31 March. During the battle with Tatya Tope's
                forces part of the British forces continued the siege and by 2 April it was decided to launch an assault by a breach 
                in the walls. Four columns assaulted the defences at different points and those attempting 
                to scale the walls came under heavy fire. Two other columns had already entered the city and were approaching the palace 
                together. Determined resistance was encountered in every street and in every room of the palace. Street fighting continued into 
                the following day and no quarter was given, even to women and children. "No maudlin clemency was to mark the fall of the city"
                wrote Thomas Lowe. The Rani withdrew from the palace to the fort and after taking counsel decided that since resistance in 
                the city was useless she must leave and join either Tatya Tope or Rao Sahib (Nana Sahib's nephew).
            </p>
            <p>According to tradition with Damodar Rao on her back she jumped on her horse Badal from the fort; they survived but the horse died.
                The Rani escaped in the night with her son, surrounded by guards.The escort included the warriors Khuda Bakhsh Basharat Ali (commandant),
                Gulam Gaus Khan, Dost Khan, Lala Bhau Bakshi, Moti Bai, Sunder-Mundar, Kashi Bai, Deewan Raghunath Singh and Deewan Jawahar Singh.
                She decamped to Kalpi with a few guards, where she joined additional rebel forces, including Tatya Tope.They occupied the town of Kalpi and
                prepared to defend it.
                On 22 May British forces attacked Kalpi; the forces were commanded by the Rani herself and were again defeated.
            </p>

            <strong>Fight to Gwalior</strong>
            <hr>
            <p>The leaders (the Rani of Jhansi, Tatya Tope, the Nawab of Banda, and Rao Sahib) fled once more. They came to Gwalior and joined the 
                Indian forces who now held the city (Maharaja Scindia having fled to Agra from the battlefield at Morar). They moved on to Gwalior 
                intending to occupy the strategic Gwalior Fort and the rebel forces occupied the city without opposition. The rebels proclaimed Nana
                 Sahib as Peshwa of a revived Maratha dominion with Rao Sahib as his governor (subedar) in Gwalior. The Rani was unsuccessful in trying 
                 to persuade the other rebel leaders to prepare to defend Gwalior against a British attack which she expected would come soon. General Rose's 
                 forces took Morar on 16 June and then made a successful attack on the city.

            <strong>Maharani's Death </strong>
            <hr>
            <p>On 17 June in Kotah-ki-Serai near the Phool Bagh of Gwalior, a squadron of the 8th (King's Royal Irish) Hussars, under Captain Heneage, fought 
                the large Indian force commanded by Rani Lakshmibai, who was trying to leave the area. The 8th Hussars charged into the Indian force, slaughtering
                5,000 Indian soldiers, including any Indian "over the age of 16".They took two guns and continued the charge right through the Phool Bagh encampment.
                In this engagement, according to an eyewitness account, Rani Lakshmibai put on a sowar's uniform and attacked one of the hussars; she was unhorsed and 
                also wounded, probably by his sabre. Shortly afterwards, as she sat bleeding by the roadside, she recognised the soldier and fired at him with a pistol,
                whereupon he "dispatched the young lady with his carbine".According to another tradition Rani Lakshmibai, the Queen of Jhansi, dressed as a 
                cavalry leader, was badly wounded; not wishing the British to capture her body, she told a hermit to burn it. 
                After her death a few local people cremated her body.
            </p>
            <p>The British captured the city of Gwalior after three days. In the British report of this battle, Hugh Rose commented that Rani Lakshmibai is
                "personable, clever and beautiful" and she is "the most dangerous of all Indian leaders".Rose reported that she had been buried "with great ceremony under a tamarind tree under the Rock of
                Gwalior, where I saw her bones and ashes".
            </p>
            <p>Her tomb is in the Phool Bagh area of Gwalior. <br> 
                <p>Twenty years after her death Colonel Malleson wrote in the History of the Indian Mutiny; vol. 3; London, 1878-</p>
            <blockquote><i><pre>Whatever her faults in British eyes may have been, 
her countrymen will ever remember that she was driven by ill-treatment into rebellion, 
and that she lived and died for her country, We cannot forget her contribution for India</pre></i></blockquote>
